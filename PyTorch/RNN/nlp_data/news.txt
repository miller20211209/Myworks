Nadal went into this match with a 22-0 record in Grand Slams this year, having won the Australian Open and French Open titles before withdrawing from Wimbledon after his quarter-final victory with an abdominal injury.

That injury restricted his build-up to the US Open with Nadal arriving at Flushing Meadows having playing only once since, a defeat by Borna Coric in Cincinnati.

He has struggled for fluency in New York, particularly in his second-round match against Fabio Fognini, and showed similar nerves on serve against Tiafoe.

Having changed his ball toss to protect the injury that ended his Wimbledon campaign, Nadal looked shorn of speed and confidence on his serve, and was broken by Tiafoe at 3-3 in the opener.

After losing the first set, Nadal disappeared off court with the physiotherapist for eight minutes and appeared to have strapping added to his wrists.

Although his serve never clicked - he finished with nine double faults to nine aces - he was able to take advantage of one poor Tiafoe service game at 5-4 in the second, being gifted the set by a Tiafoe double fault.

The third set mirrored the first, Tiafoe breaking for a 4-3 lead with a fine backhand winner, and the American delighted his home crowd as he closed it out with an ace.

Nadal appeared reinvigorated in the fourth set and was helped by Tiafoe becoming distracted as the roof closed during his service game at 2-1 down.

Nadal broke serve but Tiafoe, helped by two Nadal double faults, responded instantly, and produced some excellent counter-punching to break twice more on his way to clinching victory.
